          Scarlett Ingrid Johansson (/dʒoʊˈhænsən/;[1] born November 22, 1984)
          is an American actress. The world's highest-paid actress in 2018 and
          2019, she has featured multiple times on the Forbes Celebrity 100
          list. Time named her one of the 100 most influential people in the
          world in 2021. Johansson's films have grossed over $14.3 billion
          worldwide, making her the highest-grossing box office star of all
          time. She first appeared on stage in an off-Broadway play as a child
          actor. Johansson made her film debut in the fantasy comedy North
          (1994) and gained early recognition for her roles in Manny & Lo
          (1996), The Horse Whisperer (1998), and Ghost World (2001). Her shift
          to adult roles came in 2003 with Lost in Translation, and won a BAFTA
          Award for Best Actress for this performance. She continued to gain
          praise for playing a 17th-century servant in Girl with a Pearl Earring
          (2003), a troubled teenager in A Love Song for Bobby Long (2004) and a
          seductress in Match Point (2005). The latter marked her first
          collaboration with Woody Allen, who later directed her in Scoop (2006)
          and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). Johansson's other works of this
          period include The Prestige (2006) and the albums Anywhere I Lay My
          Head (2008) and Break Up (2009), both of which charted on the
          Billboard 200.
